## Project Details

Build a jigsaw puzzle that has a full drag and drop interface. You will need to work with times (setTimeout and setInterval) and some JavaScript events, including the drag and drop events. You may also need the dragenter/dragleave, and dragstart/dragend events, and you will need the data stored within the dataTransfer property of the event object to process a drag and drop operation.
